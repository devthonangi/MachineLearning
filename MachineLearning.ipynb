    "Combined Discussion & Conclusion for Task 2: Gunshot Audio Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model Comparison:\n",
    "   - The LSTM and CNN models both achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with the CNN model slightly edging out the LSTM model in accuracy. The choice between the models may depend on factors such as interpretability and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Overfitting Considerations:\n",
    "   - The CNN model demonstrated robust performance without clear signs of overfitting. In contrast, the LSTM model, despite achieving excellent metrics, showed potential overfitting. This highlights the importance of monitoring model behavior during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM and CNN models showcase strong performance in detecting gunshot audio. The CNN model, with its spatial hierarchy capture, performs slightly better in terms of accuracy. It's essential to address potential overfitting in the LSTM model through careful regularization techniques. The choice between models should consider specific requirements and constraints, and further experimentation can lead to refined and optimized models for gunshot audio detection."
